## VulnsDB
This directory contains an example of **database in Spanish in order to translate Nessus reports** with secutils. This file is not complete and must be updated continously; also it contains a lot of translation mistakes.

It would be awesome if you could help with translations, corrections and/or more databases from other languages. Any help will be appreciated and you can mail me if you have updates or additions to the vulns database.

> Note that `VulnDB_Spanish.xls` file is deprecated now. SQLite files are needed for `secutils` to work.
