Secutils v3.0  
Release date: 26/Apr/2019

>[-/+] Classes redefined by funtionality (more scalable)  
>[-/+] CLI colors redefinition (now works in Windows also)  
>[-/+] Excel sheets renamed  
>[-/+] Update from xls to xlsx reports format  
>[-] Removed funtionality to add reports to previous created Excel files in order to improve speed execution; moreover it's easier to move one sheet from a workbook to another using Excel itself rather than loading a whole file and editing it with python. Thus xlsxwriter is used instead of openpyxl and xlwt/rd.  
>[-] Acunetix & Netsparker modules temporarily deprecated (working on this and other tools to parse)
